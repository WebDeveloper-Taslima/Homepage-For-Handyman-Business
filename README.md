# Homepage-For-Handyman-Business
This project is a modern homepage redesign for Stan The Handyman, a local home repair and renovation business. The goal was to refresh the existing homepage design while maintaining the original structure, brand colors, and overall identity â€” creating a clean, trustworthy, and professional look that appeals to local homeowners.
